# Missile-Annihilation-Game

This game is created using P5JS Library that allows for interactive animations and visualizations. The aim of the game is to shoot down as many missiles as possible. 
There is a limited armoury available to the player, 10 bullets, where each shot depletes a bullet and a new bullet is replenished every few seconds. 

All animations, visuals and objects in this game are rendered purely using P5JS functionality and not using any images.
